- Grappling hook
-- Cool because it opens up possibilities from pulling you.
-- Not cool because it limits your direction to the point you grappled (removes strafing altogether while grappled)

- Implosion vs explosion (pull-push)
-- All weapons work with explosions (pushing you away from the point of impact). 
-- Implosion weeballs are cool in that they invert the direction, and you have to aim forward. Same with grappling hook.
-- It could be interesting to have some type of weapon that pulls you, instead of pushing you.
--- Rockets are slower, but push you more distance.
--- Plasma is faster, but pushes you less.
--- Explore something unique for implosion too.

Implosion Weapon:
- Slower rate than rockets, but pulls you more than rockets push you
- Creates an area of effect that stays for X time
-- The area pulls you into its center, launching you forward with its pull.
-- The area can only be shooted at solid surfaces (walls, floors, etc)
-- The farther you land from the center, the stronger the pull (like conc grenades, but inverted)
-- Allows to pre-shoot X amount of them to create a chainable effect (probably 2? maybe 3)
--- Could be abused by just firing them close to each other, and easily getting the multiplied power.
- These mechanics make the weapon behave in such a way that you have to predict where you are going to land AND how much farther you are going to go with the area-launch-acceleration plus your added strafing power.

- On demand slide powerup pickup/powerup/consumable
-- Each charge gives you X seconds of sliding in any surface.

- Wall jump powerup/pickup/consumable
-- Similar to warsow's walljump, but limited with charges/ammunition.

- Dash powerup/pickup/consumable
-- Similar to diabotical's Dash/Boost, but limited with charges/ammunition.

- Air double-jump powerup/pickup/consumable:
-- Similar to Scout TF2 double-jump, but limited with charges/ammunition

Other weapons ideas:
Source weapons as pickup on defrag:
- Conc grenades 
- Sticky launcher
- TF2 Rocket launcher
-- Different in that it needs reloading, and knockback physics work differently
-- Could even keep crouch jumping/etc for 1:1 replication)
