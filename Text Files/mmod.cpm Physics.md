mmod.CPM physics:
***
Features:
- Differential strafing
- No snapzones
- Regular W-turning power from cpm (or maybe no W-turning at all)
- Q4 Crouch sliding for sharp turns (no slide acceleration. ?maybe?)

- Q2+CPM ramps mix:
-- Sliding up the ramp if no input.
-- Jumping while in the ramp triggers the same loss of speed that cpm does.
-- Double jumping from a ramp has the same 400ms timer as a double jump
