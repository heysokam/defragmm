Defrag Modes:
Definition, ideas, examples and reasoning behind each of them
*********************************************
1. Classic Defrag
- 1:1 port of the classic vq3&cpm defrag gameplay into the source engine
- Their rulesets are kept intact, and tweaked to be as close as possible to the original game
- Has two leaderboards:
-- 1. CPM
-- 2. VQ3
- Prefix df_

2. Speed Defrag
- Based around time-to-complete gameplay.
- Same gamemode as classic defrag, but with mmod custom physics / weapons / powerups / etc
- Separating Custom physics and Classic physics into two modes prevents the leaderboards from being overly confusing and convoluted.
- Has two leaderboards:
-- 1. mmod.CPM
-- 2. mmod.VQ3
--- Both physics use differential strafing as a core
--- Both tweaked to respect the core elements of the classic gameplay feel, but with added complexity and mechanics
--- The same mmod.vq3 physics ruleset is used in the Tech mode.
- Prefix dfs_

3. Tech Defrag
- Oriented towards difficulty-to-complete gameplay.
- Also allows/encourages time-to-complete, but to a lesser degree than the Speed Mode.
- Explained more in depth in this text:

- Has one leaderboard (mmod.vq3)
- Prefix dft_

4. Tricks Defrag
- Based on Freestyle Defrag trickjumping, combined with the "trick design" elements from tricksurfing (freestyle surfing).
- Physics are an optional selectable feature for each trick.
- Players who desing a trick can select the physics in which the trick should be performed.
- Video reference of what's possible in Freestyle defrag (aka defrag tricks): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYbQIsAtlnY
- Prefix (?TBD?):  dfree_, free_, dftr_, dftricks_, (something else?)

*********************************************
Naming & reasons for separating each mode:
***********************
Separated Classic & Speed modes:
- Keeps the leaderboards from being extremely confusing and convoluted by a high number of different physics (four rulesets total):
-- 1. Classic CPM
-- 2. Classic VQ3
-- 3. MMod CPM
-- 4. MMod VQ3

Classic mode:
- Signals the player, already by its name, that the original defrag mechanics are supposed to be there and are kept as "classic" and intact as possible.

Speed mode:
- Contrasted with classic mode: Signals the player that a different ruleset from "classic defrag" is to be expected.
- Contrasted with tech mode: Signals the player that the gameplay is focused around going fast and beating a timer.

Tech mode:
- Contrasted with Speed mode: Signals the player that the gameplay is focused around technical movement and difficulty is expected.

Tricks mode:
- Freestyle defrag is really fun, but it's underplayed because most people are not creative enough to come up with their own tricks. Specially when starting out in the mode.
- Having the same backbone as tricksurfing, where players can design tricks for everyone to try, makes freestyle more accessible for average defrag runners that might not be so creative, and gives those creative players another reason to keep designing jumps and build a community around this mode.
