### mmod.defrag Original Maps
- df_oak (rampslides, rampjumps, stairjumps, slick and AD spacing. Made for "exec phys_mmod_race")

### Strafing maps:
- df_cpmjump1 (for testing ad-turning)
- df_pornstar_slopin (for testing ramps down and high speed strafing)
- df_nood_inder (for testing ramps up and strafing in real situations)
- df_r7_tech (fun strafe map, with emphasis in AD strafing)

### Bhop_ maps that play well on mmod.Defrag:   
- bhop_tron_evolution (Amazing for ramps up+down and strafing. 10/10. Link: https://gamebanana.com/mods/289480)  

_..._   
_Rename bsp map file to df_MAPNAME.bsp for them to load defrag physics automatically._  
_Otherwise, you'll need to write "mom_gamemode_override 10" before loading the map, everytime._  

### Ports from defrag to bhop by other mappers
- bhop_kool_short3 (Link: https://gamebanana.com/mods/125367)
- bhop_dfwc2017_6 (Link: https://gamebanana.com/mods/124834)

_..._   
*same thing. rename bhop_ to df_.*

### Test maps:  
- df_test_box (simple square box for turning around in a small-ish space)
- df_test_circlejump (240to480u in 20u increases, for testing circlejumps)
- df_test_gridlimits (visual representation of the current maximum size of a map. timed. 32k^3 units)
- df_test_stepup (each pad is 1u farther away than the previous one. for testing walking over gaps with the stepup mechanic)
- df_test_straightline (32k units long corridor. has a timer)
- df_test_curvedwall (simple room, with different types geometry for curved walls)
- df_test_multijumps (for testing multijumps of different heights and depths)
- df_stairwaytoheaven (silly map for practicing additive multijumps. Left is +30u, right is +40u and mid is +40u deep and +40u high)

_Made for testing different things about the physics._  
_Please request a map on mmod-discord if you want to try something but there's no map made for it yet._  

### Challenge maps:
- df_infernus (expert strafing pads)
- df_palmslane (expert strafing pads, slightly easier than infernus)
- df_kairos_20min (easy-ish and short-ish torture map. emphasis on "ish")
- df_stonerun2 (trickmap with short torture-like section)

### Others:
- b0_beta6: It has only been textured. Needs a lot of work to connect teleport locations & doors.
